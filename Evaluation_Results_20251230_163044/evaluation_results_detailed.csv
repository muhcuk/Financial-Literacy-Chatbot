what is financial literacy,"Financial literacy refers to the knowledge and skills needed to manage personal finances effectively. It involves understanding how to make informed decisions about money management, saving, investing, budgeting, and credit management. Financial literacy is not just about knowing how to handle money; it's also about developing a healthy relationship with money and making smart financial choices that can impact one's well-being and long-term goals.","Financial literacy is the knowledge and skills that help a person understand money and make smart decisions about managing it. This includes knowing how to budget, save, spend, borrow, invest, and plan for future financial needs such as education, housing, or retirement. Financial literacy also involves understanding concepts like credit, interest, insurance, and how financial products work so people can choose what?€?s best for their situation.

What is saving?,"Saving refers to setting aside a portion of your money in a safe and stable place, such as a bank account or investment fund. It's not just about putting money away; it's about making conscious choices about how you use your money and ensuring that you have enough for your future needs.","Saving means setting aside a portion of your income instead of spending it now so that the money can be used later. It is the part of your earnings that is not used for immediate consumption but is kept for future needs, goals, or emergencies, often in a safe place like a savings account at a bank or another secure form. In personal finance, saving refers specifically to preserving money for future use rather than spending it on current expenses",0.343895131,0.7459402,0.916398168,0.25
What is budgeting?,"Budgeting refers to the process of managing one's expenses and financial resources effectively. It involves making conscious choices about how to allocate money towards different aspects of life, such as needs versus wants, short-term pleasures versus long-term financial security.","Budgeting means creating a plan that shows how you will spend and save your money so that your income is enough to cover your expenses and help you reach your financial goals. A budget lets you track how much money you get (your income) and how much you spend on things like bills, food, transport and other costs, and then decide in advance what should go where instead of guessing as you spend. It is a tool for managing your money responsibly, helping you see where your money is going, make informed choices about spending, and plan for saving and future needs.",0.150075697,0.69894826,0.892344832,0.141304348
What is income?,"Income refers to the money earned or received by an individual in exchange for their work, skills, or services. It's the primary source of revenue that allows individuals to support themselves and achieve their financial goals.","Income is the money or value that a person or business receives in exchange for work, services, selling goods, or from investments and other sources. For an individual, income usually includes wages or salaries from a job, money earned from investments like interest or dividends, and other earnings received over a period of time such as monthly or annually.",0.329614893,0.75376344,0.948652983,0.225806452
What is an expense?,"An expense refers to the amount of money spent or incurred by an individual or household for something that has value. Expenses can be categorized into two main types: fixed expenses and variable expenses. Fixed expenses are those that remain the same every month, such as rent, utilities, and loan payments. These expenses are considered essential because they are necessary for daily life.","An expense is money that you spend or have to pay for goods and services. In personal finance, expenses are the outflows of money from your income to cover things you need or choose to buy, such as food, transport, bills, clothes, school supplies and other living costs. An expense can be something you pay regularly, like rent or a phone bill, or something occasional, like new shoes or a repair.",0.313623394,0.7275067,0.855267048,0.191011236
What is interest?,"Interest is essentially the cost of borrowing money. Think of it like renting someone else's money for a period of time. When you borrow money, whether it's from a bank or through financing an item, you agree to pay back the amount borrowed plus some extra as a thank you for using their money. This extra amount is called interest.","Interest is the extra amount of money that is paid or earned in return for using someone?€?s money over time. When you borrow money, interest is the cost you pay on top of the original amount you borrowed, usually calculated as a percentage of that amount over a set period of time. When you save or lend money, interest is the reward you receive for letting others use your money, also usually expressed as a percentage of what you saved or lent. The percentage used to calculate this extra amount is called the interest rate, and it can change how much you pay or earn depending on the terms of the loan or savings product.",0.61757142,0.7483494,0.91188848,0.266666667
What is a bank account and what are the main types of bank accounts?,"A bank account is a financial account held at a banking institution, where you can manage your money, pay bills, and make transactions. Having a bank account allows you to keep track of your financial transactions, save money, and earn interest. There are several main types of bank accounts, including: Current Account (also known as Cheque Account): This type of account is designed for everyday transactions, such as paying bills, receiving salaries, and making purchases.
Savings Account: A savings account is a type of deposit account that earns interest on your deposited funds, allowing you to save money over time.
Fixed Deposit Account: Also known as Time Deposits, these accounts offer a fixed interest rate for a specific period, usually ranging from a few months to several years.","A bank account is a safe place at a bank or financial institution where you can keep your money, manage it, and use it when you need to pay for things or save for the future. When you deposit money into a bank account, the bank holds it for you, and you can usually withdraw it, transfer it, or use it to pay bills or receive money like wages and allowances. Bank accounts also help you keep records of your spending and saving and can sometimes earn interest over time. There are several main types of bank accounts, each designed for different purposes:

A checking account (also called a current account in some places) is meant for everyday use. It lets you easily deposit and withdraw money, pay bills, and use a debit card for purchases. These accounts usually offer quick access to your money but may earn little or no interest. A savings account is designed to help you set money aside and earn interest on what you save. You can still withdraw money when needed, but savings accounts are more about storing and growing money rather than spending it every day. A money market account is a type of savings account that often offers a higher interest rate while still allowing some access to your funds, sometimes including check writing or debit card use, though there may be limits on transactions. A certificate of deposit (CD) or fixed deposit account asks you to leave a sum of money in the bank for a set period in exchange for a higher interest rate. You usually pay a penalty if you take the money out before the term ends, but these accounts are useful for longer-term savings goals where you won?€?t need the cash right away.",0.54657686,0.77516365,0.850754321,0.290502793
What is debt and when is it necessary to borrow money?,"Debt is essentially borrowing money from someone or somewhere to use it for a specific purpose. It can be good debt or bad debt, depending on how you manage it. So, when is it necessary to borrow money? It's only necessary to take on debt when you have a solid plan in place and can repay the loan with interest. This means having a clear understanding of how much you need to borrow, how you'll use the funds, and how you'll manage your payments. By making informed decisions about borrowing, you can avoid getting trapped in costly debt and make progress towards your financial goals.","Debt is the money that someone borrows from another person, a bank, or an institution and is obligated to pay back later, usually with extra cost in the form of interest added on top of the amount borrowed. When you borrow money, you become a debtor, and the person or organization that lends the money is called a creditor. Debt can take many forms such as loans, mortgages, credit card balances, and other financial obligations where repayment is required by an agreed timeline. Borrowing money becomes necessary in situations where you cannot afford to pay for something important with your current funds but need it for a worthwhile purpose. For example, families and individuals often take on debt to buy a home or a car, to pay for higher education, or to invest in something that can improve future income or quality of life. These types of borrowing are usually planned, involve understanding repayment, and are taken when the borrower is confident they can manage the repayments.",0.451655327,0.70186645,0.805231333,0.194805195
What is investment and how is it different from saving?,"Saving and investing are two distinct concepts that often get mixed up. Saving refers to setting aside money for immediate needs or short-term goals, such as building an emergency fund or paying for daily expenses. The primary focus of saving is to preserve the principal amount and maintain its value over time. On the other hand, investing involves putting money into assets that have a potential for growth, such as stocks, bonds, or real estate. Investing aims to generate returns through dividends, interest, or capital appreciation, with the goal of achieving long-term financial goals.","Investment means putting your money into something with the expectation that it will grow in value or earn income over time. This can include things like buying stocks, bonds, property, or other assets where you hope the value will increase or provide returns such as dividends or interest. When you invest, you are typically willing to take on some level of risk because higher risk often comes with a chance of higher returns over the long term. Investment differs from saving in several important ways. Saving means setting money aside in a safe place, like a bank account, where the risk of losing the money is very low and you can access it easily when needed. The purpose of saving is mainly to preserve your money for short-term goals or emergencies, and it usually earns only a small amount of interest. Investing, on the other hand, is aimed at growing your money over the long term and can involve more risk because the value of investments can go up or down. While savings provide security and easy access, investments offer the potential for greater growth but without a guarantee of returns.",0.484290804,0.7498651,0.733203053,0.213836478
What is insurance and why do people need it?,"Insurance is a financial protection plan that helps cover unexpected medical expenses when you're unable to pay for them out-of-pocket. It's like having a safety net that ensures you can receive quality care without breaking the bank. People need insurance because it provides peace of mind and financial security in case of unexpected medical events, such as heart disease or hospital stays. Without insurance, these costs can be overwhelming and may even require selling assets or taking on debt to cover expenses. Insurance helps prevent this by covering a significant portion of medical bills, allowing you to focus on getting better rather than worrying about the cost.","Insurance is a financial arrangement or legal contract between a person (or business) and an insurance company where the person pays regular amounts called premiums, and in return the insurer agrees to provide financial protection or compensation if specific unexpected events happen. These events might include things like an accident, illness, damage to property, or loss of life, and the goal of insurance is to reduce the financial burden when such losses occur by covering all or part of the costs. People need insurance because life is unpredictable and unexpected costs can be very high. Without insurance, incidents such as a serious illness, a car accident, or damage to important belongings could require a large amount of money that many individuals or families might not be able to pay from their savings. Insurance acts as a safety net that helps protect financial stability, provides peace of mind, and ensures that you or your family have support to cover major expenses during difficult times. It makes it easier to focus on daily life and long-term plans without worrying that a sudden loss could ruin your finances.",0.504572244,0.7389538,0.823339581,0.25748503
What is inflation and how does it affect purchasing power?,"??Inflation is when the prices of goods and services increase over time. This means that the value of money decreases, and the same amount of currency can't buy as much as it could before. To understand how inflation affects purchasing power, imagine your savings. Say you had RM10 back in the early 2000s, which could buy a bunch of vegetables. But now, the same amount might only cover the cost of two types of vegetables. That's because prices have increased over time due to inflation. This means that the value of your money has decreased.","Inflation is the general increase in the prices of goods and services across an economy over time. When inflation happens, things like food, transport, housing costs and other everyday items become more expensive than they were before. It is usually measured by looking at how the price of a representative set of common goods and services changes over a specific period, such as one year. Inflation affects purchasing power, which is the amount of goods and services that a unit of money can buy at a given time. As prices rise due to inflation, the same amount of money buys fewer goods and services than before. This means that if your income does not increase at the same rate as inflation, you lose purchasing power because your money does not stretch as far as it used to.",0.613559195,0.7534645,0.847832203,0.285714286
What is EPF (Employees Provident Fund) and how does it help Malaysians save for retirement?,"EPF stands for Employees Provident Fund, which is a retirement savings program in Malaysia. It provides a reliable avenue for individuals to save for their future financial security. The EPF offers Malaysians a solid foundation for long-term financial planning, boasting compelling dividend rates and a range of benefits. The EPF allows members to contribute voluntarily on top of their existing mandatory monthly deductions, with a maximum limit of RM100,000 per year. This flexibility enables individuals to align their investments with personal values and financial objectives while upholding ethical and religious principles through the Shariah-compliant option, Simpanan Shariah.","The Employees Provident Fund (EPF), known in Malay as Kumpulan Wang Simpanan Pekerja (KWSP), is Malaysia?€?s main retirement savings scheme managed by a government body under the Ministry of Finance. It was established to help workers build long-term savings for when they stop working, and it requires regular contributions from both employees and employers while the person is working. Under this system, a portion of your salary is automatically set aside each month along with a matching contribution from your employer. These contributions are credited into your EPF account and are invested by the fund so your savings can grow over time through annual dividends. The goal of this compulsory savings plan is to ensure that Malaysians can accumulate enough money to support themselves financially once they retire and are no longer earning a regular income.",0.288637787,0.7318978,0.862081766,0.137254902
What tax reliefs and deductions are available for Malaysian taxpayers?,"As a Malaysian taxpayer, you are eligible for various tax reliefs and deductions to reduce your taxable income. Two notable tax reliefs are available through the Employees Provident Fund (EPF): EPF Contributions and Life Insurance Premiums. For Private Sector Employees & Non-Pensionable Public Servants, the tax relief limit is up to RM4,000 for EPF contributions and RM3,000 for life insurance premiums or both. This totals a maximum of RM7,000 in tax relief. For Pensionable Public Servants, the tax relief has been expanded to include retirement savings with the EPF, allowing them to benefit from this tax relief as well.","In Malaysia, individual taxpayers can reduce the amount of tax they owe by claiming various tax reliefs and deductions against their chargeable income before calculating tax. These reliefs include a standard personal relief (for yourself and dependants), which is usually around RM9,000, and additional reliefs for things like education fees, medical and healthcare expenses, retirement savings such as life insurance and EPF contributions, interest on housing loans for first-time homebuyers, and other eligible personal outlays. There are also reliefs for parents?€? medical costs, childcare fees, disability support, and savings in approved education schemes like SSPN. These tax reliefs serve to lower the taxable income amount, so you pay less income tax overall, and you can only claim them if you meet the eligibility criteria and provide supporting documentation when necessary.",0.435478203,0.73271626,0.85519278,0.185714286
What is the difference between conventional banking and Islamic banking in Malaysia?,"Conventional banking in Malaysia is based on interest-based lending, where banks charge interest on loans to borrowers. This type of banking has been widely adopted globally, but its practices have raised concerns among Muslims who follow the Islamic faith. In contrast, Islamic banking in Malaysia adheres to Shariah principles, which prohibit the charging and payment of interest (riba). Instead, Islamic banks use alternative methods to earn profits, such as profit-sharing schemes or risk-based pricing. This approach aims to create a more equitable and transparent financial system that aligns with Islamic values.","Conventional banks operate on the mainstream financial system where the bank accepts deposits and lends money while charging and paying interest (known as interest-based lending). They make profit mainly through interest charged on loans and by paying a smaller interest to depositors. In this system, the relationship between the bank and the customer is largely that of creditor and debtor, and the bank transfers most of the repayment risk to the borrower. Conventional banks can invest in a wide range of sectors based on commercial considerations, without religious constraints. Islamic banking, on the other hand, must follow Shariah law, which prohibits riba (interest) and requires that financial transactions be based on real economic activity such as trade, leasing, profit-sharing or partnership. Instead of charging interest, Islamic banks earn returns through profit and loss sharing, trade transactions or asset leases, and financial products are structured around contracts like Murabaha (cost-plus sale), Mudarabah (profit sharing), Musharakah (joint partnership) and Ijarah (leasing). Islamic banking also avoids investments in activities considered unethical under Shariah, such as alcohol, gambling, and speculative transactions. The relationship between the bank and the customer is therefore more like partners, buyers and sellers, with risks and rewards shared. Islamic banks have Shariah supervisory boards to ensure all products comply with Islamic law.",0.478694723,0.7437351,0.710286617,0.181318681
What is the difference between needs and wants?,"Needs refer to essential items that are necessary for survival, well-being, or long-term goals. These can include basic necessities like food, shelter, clothing, healthcare, education, and personal safety. Needs are typically non-discretionary, meaning they cannot be easily substituted with alternative options. Examples of needs include rent/mortgage, utilities, groceries, transportation, and tuition fees. Wants, on the other hand, are discretionary items that bring pleasure or satisfaction but are not essential for survival. These can include luxuries like dining out, entertainment, hobbies, travel, or clothing. Wants are typically non-essential and can be substituted with alternative options if necessary. The key difference between needs and wants is that needs should take priority over wants in terms of spending decisions.","Needs are the things you must have to survive and function in daily life, such as food, basic clothing, housing or shelter, essential healthcare and utilities. These are expenditures that are essential for your safety, health and ability to work, and without them your well-being would be at risk. Wants, on the other hand, are things you desire but do not absolutely need to live. They are non-essential items that make life more comfortable, fun or enjoyable, such as eating out, brand-name clothes, travelling, entertainment or luxury gadgets. Wants enhance your quality of life but you could still get by without them if you had to. Understanding the difference helps you prioritise spending ?€? meeting your needs first before spending on wants ?€? which is an important part of budgeting and managing your money responsibly.",0.383168116,0.74120575,0.88635397,0.214765101
What is Amanah Saham Bumiputera (ASB) and who can invest in it?,"Amanah Saham Bumiputera (ASB) is a type of investment product offered by the Malaysian government. It was introduced in 1994 as part of the government's economic stimulus plan to encourage Malaysians to invest in the stock market. ASB allows individuals, including Malaysian citizens and permanent residents, to invest in the stock market through a unit-linked savings scheme. To be eligible to invest in ASB, you must be a Malaysian citizen or a permanent resident of Malaysia. You can also apply for ASB if you are a foreign national who has been living in Malaysia for more than 3 years. The minimum investment amount for ASB is RM 1,000, and the maximum limit varies depending on your age and income.","Amanah Saham Bumiputera (often called ASB) is a unit trust investment fund in Malaysia that was launched by Amanah Saham Nasional Berhad (ASNB), a major unit trust management company wholly owned by Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB). ASB is designed to serve as a long-term, relatively low-risk investment vehicle that aims to generate consistent returns over time for its investors. It is structured so each unit typically has a fixed price, and returns are usually distributed to investors in the form of dividends based on the fund?€?s performance. ASB was originally created primarily for Malaysian Bumiputera investors, meaning eligible Malays, Indigenous people of Sabah and Sarawak (as defined under the Federal Constitution), and Orang Asli. This eligibility allows them to open and hold ASB accounts, invest in the fund, and receive dividends on their holdings. Typically, only Bumiputera individuals and eligible minors with a Malaysian guardian can invest directly in ASB. Accounts can be opened for adults aged 18 and above with a valid identity card, and for minors (younger than 18) via a registered guardian who is also a Malaysian and meets the age requirement.",0.482130396,0.7317311,0.831042051,0.173184358
"What is the difference between SOCSO, EIS, and EPF contributions for Malaysian employees?","SOCSO (Social Security Organisation) contributes to the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF), but it is not the same as contributing directly to EPF. SOCSO's contribution is a mandatory requirement for all employees in Malaysia, which includes 12% of their monthly salary, deducted by their employer. This contribution is then deposited into the employee's EPF account. EIS (Employee Investment Scheme) and EPF contributions are two separate types of savings plans offered to Malaysian employees. EIS allows employees to invest a portion of their EPF savings in various investment products, such as stocks or bonds, while EPF contributions are mandatory for all employees, with the employer contributing 12% and the employee contributing 8%. The difference lies in the investment options available under EIS, which provides more flexibility and potential returns compared to EPF's fixed dividend rate.","EPF (Employees Provident Fund) is a mandatory retirement savings scheme where both the employee and the employer contribute a portion of the employee?€?s salary each month into a personal savings account managed by the EPF Board. The main purpose of EPF is to help employees accumulate savings over their working life so they have money available when they retire, and under certain conditions you can also use part of the savings for things like housing or education before retirement. Both Malaysians and permanent residents must contribute, while foreign employees may contribute voluntarily if agreed. SOCSO (Social Security Organisation) contributions provide social security protection against work-related risks, such as injury at work, disability, illness, and in some cases support for dependants if a worker dies due to a workplace incident. SOCSO contributions are also made monthly by both the employee and employer, but instead of building a retirement savings fund, the contributions go into a social insurance pool that pays out benefits if those risks occur. All eligible workers, including foreign employees, are generally covered under SOCSO. EIS (Employment Insurance System) is a relatively newer insurance contribution that provides temporary financial assistance and job-seeking support to employees who lose their jobs involuntarily. Under EIS, both the employer and employee contribute a small percentage of the employee?€?s wages (0.2 % each of assumed monthly salary) to fund unemployment benefits and re-employment services. This system is separate from SOCSO and focuses on helping workers find new jobs and cope financially after job loss.",0.520964237,0.72806156,0.779363751,0.190909091
What are the different types of income?,"Income can be broadly categorized into three main types:

Salary: This is the most common type of income, which is earned by individuals in exchange for their work and skills. It's usually paid on a regular basis, such as monthly or bi-weekly.
Investment Income: This type of income is generated from investments such as dividends, interest, rents, and capital gains. It's typically passive income that requires little to no effort to earn.
Self-Employed Income: This type of income is earned by individuals who work for themselves or their own businesses. It can include profits from freelancing, entrepreneurship, or other business ventures.","Earned income is the money you receive in exchange for work or services you perform. This includes wages, salaries, tips, bonuses, commissions and income from self-employment or running a business where you actively participate. This type of income depends on your effort and time. 

Passive income is money you earn without actively working for it on a regular basis once the underlying asset or system is set up. Examples can include rental income from property, royalties from creative works, income from a business you don?€?t actively manage, and other recurring earnings after an initial investment of time or money. 

Portfolio income (sometimes called investment income) comes from financial investments such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds or real estate investment trusts (REITs). This includes interest, dividends and capital gains you receive from owning these assets. ",0.481482086,0.7312341,0.797729015,0.220588235
What strategies can be used to pay off credit card debt faster?,"To pay off credit card debt faster, there are two popular strategies that can be effective:

Debt Snowball Method: This approach involves clearing one debt at a time, starting with the smallest balance first. By paying off the smallest debt first, you'll experience early victories and build momentum to tackle larger debts. For example, Chong, an executive with three debts (RM1,000 personal loan, RM5,000 student loan, and RM10,000 car loan), would start by clearing the smaller personal loan.
Debt Snowflake Method: This approach involves using extra savings from daily activities to make additional debt payments. Even small amounts can significantly accelerate debt repayment and positively impact your credit record. For instance, Gunalan, a student who saves RM10 daily by bringing food from home instead of buying lunch, can use this extra amount to make an additional payment on his outstanding debts.","To begin with, it?€?s important to pay more than the minimum monthly payment whenever possible. Paying only the minimum keeps your debt for a long time and increases the amount of interest you pay overall, while larger payments reduce the balance faster and cut down interest costs. Two popular repayment methods can help you organise your debt payoff:

The debt avalanche method means making minimum payments on all cards but putting extra money toward the card with the highest interest rate first. Once that is paid off, you transfer the extra funds to the next highest-interest card. This can reduce the total interest you pay. 
The debt snowball method focuses on paying off the card with the smallest balance first while maintaining minimum payments on others. After the smallest is cleared, you move on to the next. This can provide motivation from seeing progress quickly.",0.345413636,0.71100104,0.726947844,0.173652695
What is diversification and why is it important in investing?,"Diversification is the process of spreading investments across different asset classes, sectors, or geographic regions to minimize risk and maximize returns. The idea behind diversification is that by not putting all your eggs in one basket, you can reduce the impact of any single investment performing poorly. This allows investors to ride out market fluctuations and increase the potential for long-term growth.

Diversification is important because it helps to manage risk and increase potential returns. By spreading investments across different asset classes, investors can reduce their exposure to any one particular sector or market. For example, investing in a single stock may be risky if that company experiences financial difficulties. However, by diversifying into other assets such as bonds, real estate, or international stocks, investors can reduce this risk.","Diversification in investing means spreading your money across different types of investments rather than putting it all into one place. This can include a mix of asset classes (such as stocks, bonds, cash, property or commodities), investments from different industries or companies, and even investments from different countries. The idea is that these varied investments will not all react the same way to market events ?€? while some may fall in value at certain times, others might stay steady or rise, helping balance your overall returns. Diversification is important because it helps reduce risk and manage the ups and downs of markets. When your investment portfolio is concentrated in just one type of asset, a bad outcome in that asset could significantly reduce your overall wealth. By diversifying, you avoid relying too heavily on any single investment, which lowers the chance that one poor performer will drag down your entire portfolio. A diversified approach can also smooth out returns over time, potentially making it easier to stay invested through market volatility and work toward long-term financial goals.",0.508124163,0.7509766,0.917821944,0.261363636
