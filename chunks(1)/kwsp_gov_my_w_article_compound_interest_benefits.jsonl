Of these, time plays a significant role,\nespecially for long-term goals like retirement\nsavings, as it amplifies the compounding effect\nof returns.\nTo illustrate the impact of time in compounding,\nconsider the two following scenarios.\nAhmad starts saving at age 20, contributing\nRM200 every month. He maintains this\ncommitment consistently for 40 years until age\n60 and makes no withdrawals throughout this\nperiod. By age 60, Ahmad has accumulated\napproximately RM305,000.\nDisclaimer: Calculation is based on an\nestimated interest rate of 5%; consistent\nsavings and no withdrawals made. This is for\nillustrative purposes and the actual dividend\ncalculation method differs.\nOn the other hand, Diana begins saving later at\nage 40 and contributes RM400 every month.\nBy age 60, she only manages to accumulate\napproximately RM164,000.\nCompared to Diana, Ahmad accumulates more\nsavings because he started saving at an earlier\nage, allowing hi", "created_at": "2026-01-03"}

Even though Diana\nsaves more each month, she cannot accumulate\nas much as Ahmad as she started to save later.\nThis example shows that starting to save at an\nearlier age will generate more savings than\nstarting later.\n3 tips to reap the benefits of\ncompound interest\n1) Start saving early\nPracticing saving at a young age will help you\ngenerate more savings over time, as your money\nwill have more time to compound. The longer\nyou save, the more you will be able to\naccumulate. Do allocate a portion of your\nincome for savings as soon as you start working.\nTip: Many individuals begin planning for\nretirement only later in life, which leaves them\nwith a limited timeframe to prepare\nadequately.

This will help your savings\ngrow significantly. In cases where you need to\nmake withdrawals, pace them carefully to\nensure your remaining savings can continue\nearning interest. Gradual and controlled\nwithdrawals help extend the life of your savings,\nwhereas early and excessive withdrawals can\nrapidly diminish the savings accumulated.\nWhile you are busy taking care of your day-today lives, it is important to make time to plan\nfor long-term financial goals, particularly for\nretirement. It is often procrastination that\ncauses you to miss the golden opportunity to\ngrow your savings. Start saving a small amount\ntoday and increase the amount from time to\ntime. 20 to 30 years down the road, you will see\nhow compound interest has made magic to your\nsavings.\nMember Employer Corporate Others\nRegister As A Introduction About Us Terms &\nMember Conditions\nResponsibilities Organisational\nGrow Your Structure Privacy Policy\nOnline Platform\nSavings\nCorporate Security Policy\nEmployers\nManage Your EPF Governance\nEducation Disclaimer\nAccount\nProgramme Investment\nOnline Security\nHome Ownership", "created_at": "2026-01-03"}
