One minute you’re stressing with\ndeadlines, and the next, you’re choosing insurance plans, paying\nrent and figuring out how to survive your paycheck.\nMost financial struggles don’t come from laziness, it is the reflection\nof your lack of guidance.\nBefore you start blaming yourself or people around you, financial\nilliteracy is curable when you start taking action to fix it!\nWhen you don’t have the right manual to manage your money to\nbegin with, mistakes are bound to happen and remember, they are\nessential as a part of your life. Within our mistakes, valuable lessons\nare waiting to be applied. It’s up to you on how you decide the\nstatus of the mistakes, either lift you or lock you down.\nHere are the 5 mistakes that are commonly made by beginners\nwho start financial management:\n1.Thinking the Minimum Payment is “Good Enough”\nWhen the paybill of your credit card comes, there will be a time\nhttps://www.laluarahsiad.com/blog-2/blog2 1/5\n\n11/12/25, 1:44 AM 5 Mistakes Young Adult Make With Money — Lalua Rahsiad\nyou’ll get shocked and pretend to calculate, what could possibly be\nthat outstanding amount when it obviously comes from your\nsplurging spending.\nYour eyes will catch the shining amount of the ‘minimum payment’\nand move on with it for now.

But what you didn’t know is that a\nsmall payment doesn’t reduce your debt—it stretches it. The interest\nquietly builds up like a fog and eventually, you’re stuck with the new\namount.\nAlways try to pay more than the minimum payment. If you’re\nstruggling, call your bank and ask for a balance transfer plan—you\nmight get 0% interest promo for a few months!\n2.Buying Tech or Gadgets on Installments Without Reading the\nFine Print\nIt starts with a phone upgrade. “Only $15/month!” Sounds easy,\nright? But over time, that turns into $20 for a phone, $50 for your\niPad, and $85 for your laptop.\nSuddenly, your salary is tied up in monthly payments for things you\ndon’t even use daily. Installment plans often come with hidden fees\nor high interest if you miss one payment.\nAnd now, you’re locked in—for years.\nBefore you say yes to any “easy payment” plan, calculate the total\namount you’ll pay by the end of the term. If it’s more than you\nexpected, pause. Could you wait and buy it outright later?\nIs it a want or a need?\nhttps://www.laluarahsiad.com/blog-2/blog2 2/5\n\n11/12/25, 1:44 AM 5 Mistakes Young Adult Make With Money — Lalua Rahsiad\n3.

It’s food delivery, random\nshopping hauls, extra Grab rides, and $7 lattes stacking up like\nJenga blocks.\nTrack your spending for one month—just one. A lot of “I deserve\nthis.” moments are no longer worthy when you spend like there’s\ntomorrow. Use an app or even your phone's notes. You’ll be shocked\nwhere your money goes. Awareness is free, but the returns are\nhuge.\n4. Not Knowing What Retirement Plan Can Actually Do\nBy ignoring it, you miss opportunities. You don’t review how your\nmoney is invested. You don’t increase voluntary contributions. You\ndon’t even check your account balance.\nDon’t just think of it as “just for retirement,” and ignore them until\nyou’re 50+. There are many uses—like education, house buying, and\nemergencies.\nLog in to the appropriate apps. Learn the basics. If you’re\nfreelancing or unemployed, make voluntary contributions to still\nbuild your savings. It’s your money—don’t leave it in the dark.\n5. Saying Yes to Every Social Plan Because of FOMO\nFriday dinner. Saturday brunch. Sunday movie night. A bit here and\nthere.
