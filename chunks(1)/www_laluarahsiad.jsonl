One minute you’re stressing with deadlines, and the next,\nyou’re choosing insurance plans, paying rent and figuring out how to survive your\npaycheck.\nMost financial struggles don’t come from laziness, it is the reflection of your lack of\nguidance.\nBefore you start blaming yourself or people around you, financial illiteracy is curable\nwhen you start taking action to fix it!\nWhen you don’t have the right manual to manage your money to begin with, mistakes\nare bound to happen and remember, they are essential as a part of your life. Within\nour mistakes, valuable lessons are waiting to be applied. It’s up to you on how you\ndecide the status of the mistakes, either lift you or lock you down.\nHere are the 5 mistakes that are commonly made by beginners who start financial\nmanagement:\n1.Thinking the Minimum Payment is “Good Enough”\nWhen the paybill of your credit card comes, there will be a time you’ll get shocked\nand pretend to calculate, what could possibly be that outstanding amount when it\nobviously comes from your splurging spending.\nYour eyes will catch the shining amount of the ‘minimum payment’ and move on with\nit for now. But what you didn’t know is that a small payment doesn’t reduce your debt\n—it stretches it. The interest quietly builds up like a fog and eventually, you’re stuck\nwith the new amount.\nAlways try to pay more than the minimum payment.

The interest quietly builds up like a fog and eventually, you’re stuck\nwith the new amount.\nAlways try to pay more than the minimum payment. If you’re struggling, call your\nbank and ask for a balance transfer plan—you might get 0% interest promo for a few\nmonths!\n2.Buying Tech or Gadgets on Installments Without Reading the Fine Print\nIt starts with a phone upgrade. “Only $15/month!” Sounds easy, right? But over time,\nthat turns into $20 for a phone, $50 for your iPad, and $85 for your laptop.\nSuddenly, your salary is tied up in monthly payments for things you don’t even use\ndaily. Installment plans often come with hidden fees or high interest if you miss one\npayment.\nAnd now, you’re locked in—for years.\nBefore you say yes to any “easy payment” plan, calculate the total amount you’ll pay\nby the end of the term. If it’s more than you expected, pause. Could you wait and buy\nit outright later?\nIs it a want or a need?\n3. Spending Without Tracking (a.k.a. the Money Mystery)\nYou think you’re doing fine. You didn’t buy anything “big.” But somehow, your money\njust… disappeared?\nSpoiler alert: It’s not black magic. It’s food delivery, random shopping hauls, extra\nGrab rides, and $7 lattes stacking up like Jenga blocks.\nTrack your spending for one month—just one. A lot of “I deserve this.” moments are\nno longer worthy when you spend like there’s tomorrow. Use an app or even your\nphone's notes. You’ll be shocked where your money goes. Awareness is free, but the\nr", "created_at": "2026-01-03"}

Not Knowing What Retirement Plan Can Actually Do\nBy ignoring it, you miss opportunities. You don’t review how your money is invested.\nYou don’t increase voluntary contributions. You don’t even check your account\nbalance.\nDon’t just think of it as “just for retirement,” and ignore them until you’re 50+. There\nare many uses—like education, house buying, and emergencies.\nLog in to the appropriate apps. Learn the basics. If you’re freelancing or unemployed,\nmake voluntary contributions to still build your savings. It’s your money—don’t leave it\nin the dark.\n5. Saying Yes to Every Social Plan Because of FOMO\nFriday dinner. Saturday brunch. Sunday movie night. A bit here and there. Before you\nknow it, your weekend costs you half your week’s income.\nYou don’t want to seem “cheap.” You don’t want to miss out. So you keep saying yes—\neven when you’re struggling inside. The feeling of being left out sucks, we all know\nthat, but when it costs you three months to pay it off.\nIs it really worth a 3-month commitment for a short time show-off?\nYou don’t have to say no to everything—but learn to say, “Not this time.” True friends\nunderstand.
