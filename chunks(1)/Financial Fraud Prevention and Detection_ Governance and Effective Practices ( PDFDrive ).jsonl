In fact, an ostensible decline in fi nancial fraud may have\nas much to do with the economic climate—and in particular the 2008 Financial Crisis—than with changes in the law.

It addresses fraud detection and its\naftermath so that, if fi nancial fraud should be uncovered, a company can move\nbeyond it as effi ciently as possible.

The fact is that business executives often commit fi nancial\nfraud without really thinking about it. Rarely do they plan for it to happen. And\nit’s not that the guilty executives are necessarily corrupt or dishonest. For that\nmatter, the level of individual honesty typically has little to do with it.\nAnd that is one of the great tragedies.

How does fraudulent fi nancial reporting start?\nHow does it grow? How do we prevent and detect it? And the toughest question\nof all: How do fundamentally decent people at a public company get caught up\nin such massive wrongdoing?\nWHAT IS FINANCIAL FRAUD?\nBefore taking on such questions, we need to establish some basics. In particular,\nwe need to nail down what we mean by “fi nancial fraud.”\nThe key point is that fi nancial fraud involves much more than whether\nreported fi nancial results are right or wrong. If the numbers are wrong, but\nthose pulling them together tried to get them right, there is no fraud and often\nnot even a violation of the federal securities laws. If, in contrast, those pulling\ntogether the numbers tried to manipulate things, or did so with a level of recklessness that amounted to the same thing, the situation is completely different.\nThe law can come down on the perpetrators like a ton of bricks.\nThis distinction between wrong numbers innocently prepared, and equally\nwrong numbers prepared less innocently, has long bedeviled those involved\nwith fi nancial reporting. Historically, the accounting literature went so far as\nto put in place technical terms to capture the distinction. An accounting error\nmeant an innocent mistake.

An accounting error\nmeant an innocent mistake. An accounting irregularity meant a deliberate one\n(Exhibit 1.1 ).\nWhy did the literature distinguish between the two? Because the difference\nbetween an innocent mistake and a deliberate one is comparable (to paraphrase\none U.S. jurist) to the difference between a dog that has been stumbled over and\na dog that has been kicked. Where a company fi nds an accounting error, it does\nits best to fi x it and move on. Where the wrong numbers qualify as fraud, however, the situation is completely different. When fi nancial statements are misstated because of fraud, someone has not made an innocent mistake. Someone\nhas deliberately lied. And the resulting concern is that somebody or a group\nof people is dishonest and is lying to everyone about fi nancial performance.\n\nHow Does Financial Fraud Come About? ◾ 5\nEXHIBIT 1.1 Statement on Auditing Standards No. 53’s Defi nition of “Errors\nand Irregularities”\nThe term errors refers to unintentional misstatements or omissions of amounts or\ndisclosures in fi nancial statements. Errors may involve:\n▪ Mistakes in gathering or processing accounting data from which fi nancial statements\nare prepared\n▪ Incorrect accounting estimates arising from oversight or misinterpretation of facts\n▪ Mistakes in the application of accounting principles relating to amount, classifi cation,\nmanner of presentation, or disclosure\nThe term irregulari", "created_at": "2026-01-03"}

Some level of corporate housecleaning is going to be involved.\nNone of this means that “fraud” implies that everyone in an organization\nwas in on it. Unfortunately, fraud can be brought about by just one bad apple.\nBut when we see the label fraud , we know that someone within the organization has deliberately misstated some aspect of fi nancial performance, and that\nmisstatement has seeped into the company’s publicly reported results.\nHOW DOES FINANCIAL FRAUD COME ABOUT?\nFinancial fraud can surface almost anywhere.

Companies that are big, small,\nold, new, manufacturing, service—all of them are at risk. Intriguing is that,\nregardless of the industry or nature of the company, fraudulent fi nancial\nreporting almost always seems to get its start the same way.\nAs mentioned earlier, financial fraud typically does not start with\ndishonesty. It typically does not start with a dishonest CEO or CFO. Nor does it\nstart because the company had the misfortune to hire a dishonest CPA in the\naccounting department.\n\n6 ◾ The Origin of Financial Fraud\nSimilarly, financial fraud typically does not start pursuant to a grand conspiracy or plan. It does not start with the chairperson of an executive meeting\ndeclaring, “Next item on the agenda: Let’s perpetrate a massive fraud.”\nThe sad fact is that participants in fraudulent financial reporting typically\nwanted to do their best to stay honest, decent, and honorable.

The business simply isn’t there. He has\nalready cut expenses to the bone. He has already admonished his sales force to\nmake every effort. But, as he comes to the end of the quarter, he sees he is just\nnot going to make it.\nOur division president has one of two choices. One, of course, is that he can\nreport up the chain‐of‐command that he has failed. Admitting failure, though,\nis never an attractive option, especially in an environment in which failure is\nunforgivable. So our division president looks for an alternative.

So our division president looks for an alternative. Among other\nthings, he takes a hard look at his numbers to see if there’s enough flexibility\nin his division’s financial reporting system to find a way to come up with the\nspecified earnings.\nWhat can he do? Because the president works for a manufacturing company,\nhe sees a simple solution. He realizes that during the last few days of the quarter\nhe can bring in overtime help and accelerate shipments. He does the math and\nsees that shipment acceleration would give him a couple of extra pennies in earnings. And he doesn’t think he’s planning to do anything wrong. His understanding is that, under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), if you ship\nthe goods, you are actually entitled to recognize the revenue. (He views it as sort\nof a hazy area of financial reporting.) And he figures that this is only going to be\na one‐quarter thing. He’s confident that next quarter he’ll have enough business\nto more than make up for what he is borrowing for this quarter.\nSo that’s what he chooses to do. As the quarter comes to a close, he brings in\novertime help. He accelerates shipments. He generates a couple of extra pennies\nin earnings. He meets his earnings target. And in the company he’s a big hero.\n\n8 ◾ The Origin of Financial Fraud\nBut—now he’s got a new quarter. And with the new quarter comes a new\nearnings target.

This time, though, he sees that\nshipment acceleration by itself won’t be enough. So he thinks this might be\na good time to take a look at some of his reserves. His gut tells him that his\nreserve, say, for returns is too big, and if he can reduce his reserve for returns,\nthat can translate into a couple of extra pennies in earnings.\nSo that’s what he does. In addition to again accelerating shipments, he\nreduces his reserve for returns. And, again, he meets his earnings target.\nBut—now he’s got a new quarter.

In an unforgiving stock market, the pressure on a CEO for\nshort‐term fi nancial performance can be somewhere between excruciating\nand intolerable. The CFO must understand that. At the same time, he must\nnot give in to it. He must be prepared to tell the CEO what he does not want to\nhear—”This quarter we’re not going to make it.” He must be politically sensitive to CEO attempts to override fi nancial controls through the exploitation of\njudgment calls inherent in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)\nand perceived fl exibility in the fi nancial reporting system.

Equally\nimportant are intestinal fortitude, strength of character, and unrelenting\ncommitment to integrity in fi nancial reporting. Those seeking to evaluate the\nenvironment of an organization must accept today’s reality of the horrifi c pressures to which the CEO will be subject.

Now\nwe broaden the analysis and consider the nature of the company’s industry. The\npoint here is to use extra caution when the industry is new. What is meant by\na “new” industry? It is one in which some signifi cant change—a technological innovation, governmental regulation or deregulation, pioneering business\nconcept, or something else—has created the opportunity for enthusiastic entrepreneurs either to build a new business model or to rework an old one.

To look at it another way, jumpstarting an innovative\nbusiness in a new industry provides the opportunity for humankind’s boundless capacity for optimism to expand unimpeded by experience. Unfortunately,\nthings do not always work out as hoped.\nFor that matter, the path from cradle to accounting disaster in a new\nindustry can be surprisingly predictable.

In\nthe absence of clear rules and established conventions, a company’s application of accounting principles can become as entrepreneurial as everything else\nit does. As new competitors enter the fray, the innovative accounting of one\nmay start to imitate the innovative accounting of another, and the generally\naccepted norm may evolve into an accounting approach that may not fairly\ncapture the underlying business reality. Businesses in such an industry may\nreport fabulous returns for a time, but at some point the more objective views\nof disinterested members of the financial community—academics, the financial press, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) the SEC—may\nintervene. If the accounting has become too entrepreneurial, prior‐reported\nresults may have to be revised downward.\nThe other problem with accounting in a new industry—the lack of an operational track record—is a consequence of the need to look into the future in\nreporting the results of today.

The reasons were several, but most of them revolved\naround the fact that the auditor had money. In the inevitable litigation, a typical\nCEO, company executive, or outside director might simply testify, “I was relying\non the outside auditor,” to the general satisfaction of all.\nAll, that is, except the auditor. For its part, an auditor of the era quickly came to\nrealize that it was in a no‐win position. Given the way that fi nancial fraud develops,\nby the time an accounting irregularity had surfaced the auditor would frequently\nbe in the unenviable position of having missed it for years. Subsequent scrutiny\nof the auditor’s workpapers would by defi nition show that, sure enough, had the\nauditor undertaken this or that additional task, the fraud would have been exposed.\nOnce the auditor actually entered a 1980s courtroom, the situation only\nbecame more diffi cult. There, the contention of fraud detection as an auditor’s\nresponsibility fed into a jury’s normal inclination to view the auditor as providing a “guarantee” of accuracy or “a clean bill of health,” which was accompanied by only a hazy understanding of what generally accepted auditing\n\n44 ◾ From Treadway to", "created_at": "2026-01-03"}

The common courtroom\nscenario would involve the auditor getting blamed from all sides. The auditor’s\ndefensive‐sounding response that it should be viewed as a fellow victim of the\nfraud, rather than a participant, could be a tough sell.\nIn this context, the law was no help at all. To the contrary, courts came\nto view the accounting profession almost as a vehicle for risk diversifi cation.\nThus, one state supreme court justifi ed an expansion of audit liability through\nan observation that “independent auditors have apparently been able to obtain\nliability insurance . . . to satisfy their fi nancial obligations.” Other courts similarly expanded the categories of plaintiffs who, when accounting problems surfaced, were entitled to sue. Federal courts, interpreting the federal securities\nlaws, came to the conclusion that investors could be found to have relied upon\naudit reports they had never even seen.\nWithin the accounting fi rms during the fi rst half of the 1980s, therefore,\ntwo things grew.

On the one hand, its exposure to liability seemed to be increasing\nalmost exponentially as fi nancial community frustration intensifi ed over the\nprofession’s seemingly inexplicable inability to stop fraudulent fi nancial reporting before it got out of hand. On the other hand, the ability of a typical outside\nauditor to detect fraud at the outset was limited.

The question was how to do it.\nTHE TREADWAY COMMISSION\nThe stage was thus set for what would prove to be a watershed in the evolution\nof fi nancial reporting and corporate governance: the formation of the National\nCommission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting, later known as the Treadway\nCommission after its chairman, former Securities and Exchange Commission\nmember James Treadway.

Among other things, it concluded\nthe following. Foremost, “fraudulent financial reporting usually does not begin\nwith an overt intentional act to distort the financial statements.” Rather, the\nTreadway Commission found that fraudulent financial reporting frequently\ncame about as “the culmination of a series of acts designed to respond to operational difficulties.” What tended to happen, the Commission concluded, was\nthat initially “the activities may not be fraudulent, but in time they become\nincreasingly questionable” until, finally, someone steps over the line.\nThe Treadway Commission also found that behind the individuals stepping\nover the line into financial fraud was almost always undue pressure. It might be\n“unrealistic pressures, particularly for short‐term results” or “financial pressure\nresulting from bonus plans that depend on short‐term economic performance” or\npressure from “the desire to obtain a higher price for a stock or debt offering or to\nmeet the expectation of investors.” At the core of f", "created_at": "2026-01-03"}

The Commission stated:\nThe Commission’s studies revealed that fraudulent financial reporting\nusually occurs as the result of certain environmental, institutional, or\nindividual forces and opportunities. These forces and opportunities add\npressures and incentives that encourage individuals and companies to\nengage in fraudulent financial reporting and are present to some degree\n\n46 ◾ From Treadway to Sarbanes‐Oxley\nin all companies. If the right, combustible mixture of forces and opportunities is present, fraudulent financial reporting may occur.\nAny effort to combat fraud, therefore, had to start at the top. In particular,\nresponsibility for reliable financial reporting had to reside “first and foremost at\nthe corporate level.” Thus, top management had to establish the proper “tone at\nthe top”—an attitude that demanded truth and candor in financial reporting\nand that, just as important, saw to it that pressures for financial performance\ndid not get out of hand.

Those forces might\ninclude investors, financial analysts, bankers, owners, or others—some of\nwhom may not be expected to appreciate fully the importance of the tone at\nthe top and who may rather maintain a greater interest in the bottom line.

Indeed, the Treadway Commission explicitly relegated\nthe outside auditor to “a crucial, but secondary role” and cautioned that\noutside auditors could not be viewed as “guarantors of the accuracy or the\nreliability of financial statements.” Rather, the genesis of financial fraud\ntook place as a consequence of pressures and a tone within the company,\nand if financial fraud was to be prevented and detected at the outset, the\nmechanisms to do so must exist within the corporation itself. An effect\nof the Treadway Commission’s findings and recommendations, therefore,\nwas to shift responsibility for accurate financial reporting onto the shoulders of senior management, outside directors, internal audit, and—most\nimportant—audit committees.\nUpon the report’s publication in October 1987, the findings and\nrecommendations of the Treadway Commission garnered almost extraordinary\nattention and support.

That responsibility, the accounting profession sought to demonstrate, really belonged to management.\nHere, too, one of the more signifi cant results was a clearer allocation\nof responsibility for fi nancial reporting between corporate offi cials and the\noutside auditor. One visible consequence was a revision of the standard form\nof auditor’s report, which now stated explicitly on the face of the report what\nhad earlier been buried in the underlying literature articulating GAAS: that the\n“fi nancial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management,”\nwhereas the auditor’s responsibility was only to “express an opinion on these\nfi nancial statements based on our audit.” Although the expectation gap\ninitiative also involved some assumption by the auditor of clearer responsibility\nfor the detection of fraud, it highlighted the primary responsibility as that of\ncorporate management.\nStill another development operated to affect the allocation of responsibility for fi nancial reporting between corporate offi cials and auditors.

The conventional\nwisdom, typified by a decision by the New Jersey Supreme Court, had been that\nthe placement of broad responsibility for financial reporting upon the outside\nauditor would operate, among other things, as a mechanism to enhance financial reporting and at the same time to diversify risk.

What are the\nmechanics of audit committee oversight?\nPerhaps the best place to start is with the audit committee’s responsibility.\nTHE AUDIT COMMITTEE’S RESPONSIBILITY\nIf audit committees are to be effective preventers and detectors of fi nancial\nmisreporting, we have to come to grips with exactly what we want the audit\ncommittee to do. To paraphrase Sun Tzu in T he Art of War, the army that is\neverywhere is nowhere. The main consequence of uncircumscribed and ill‐\ndefi ned responsibilities, accordingly, may be to disburse the audit committee’s\nfocus to an extent where the committee members can realistically accomplish\nnothing. The fi rst step toward installation of an effective audit committee,\ntherefore, is to defi ne for the committee its fundamental responsibility in a\ncomprehensible way.\nHere is a fairly crisp articulation: “It is the responsibility of an audit committee to oversee the company’s system of fi nancial reporting.” That’s it. This articulation is substantively identical to the purpose identifi ed by Sarbanes‐Oxley,\nwhich defi nes an audit committee as a committee e", "created_at": "2026-01-03"}

This articulation is substantively identical to the purpose identifi ed by Sarbanes‐Oxley,\nwhich defi nes an audit committee as a committee established “for the purpose\nof overseeing the accounting and fi nancial reporting processes of the issuer and\naudits of the fi nancial statements of the issuer.” In this regard, Sarbanes‐Oxley\nagain tracks the fi ndings of the Treadway Commission, which observed that,\n“Audit committees should be informed, vigilant, and effective overseers of the\nfi nancial reporting process and the company’s internal controls.”\nCritical to understanding this purpose is recognition that the audit committee’s function is merely one of oversight. Its mission is to oversee the system,\nnot to actually run it. Running the system is, and as a practical matter has to\nbe, the responsibility of the CEO, CFO, and those that report to them. The audit\ncommittee’s responsibility, in contrast, is to oversee the system, do its best to\nsee that it’s functioning properly, and actively seek out how things may be\ngoing wrong.\nCHECKLISTS, CHECKLISTS, CHECKLISTS\nHaving come to grips with the audit committee’s responsibility, we can turn to\nhow that responsibility might be fulfi lled.

Checklists for audit committees have been published by\nvirtually all the national accounting fi rms. Checklists have been published by\nthe AICPA. Checklists regularly appear in newsletters, articles, and committee\nrecommendations. Checklists are seemingly everywhere.\nThere is just one problem. If audit committee members were genuinely to\nundertake all of the tasks listed on the checklists, they would have little time\nfor anything else—such as their day jobs. One representative audit committee\nchecklist enumerates 36 time‐consuming tasks.\nChecklists are certainly a handy reference tool, but they carry with them\ndangers even beyond the need of individual audit committee members to hold\na full‐time job. One is the danger of what might be referred to as a “checklist mentality”—a mindset that dutifully marching through a checklist will\nnecessarily lead to a successful fi nancial reporting system. The audit profession\nperiodically has to remind itself that a checklist mentality simply does not work.\nThere is no reason to think that such an approach would work any better for\nan audit committee.\nAnother weakness with excessive fi delity to a checklist is the temptation to\ngive everything equal time.

Senior executives must be vividly aware of the unacceptability\nof massaged fi nancial results. This is a battle for a certain type of corporate\nculture, and therefore both big and small things mean a lot. Among the big\nthings, the audit committee chairman will want to emphasize unequivocally\nand often the dual predicates of objectivity and transparency as the bases for\nfi nancial reporting.

The audit\ncommittee will also want a vehicle for communicating that message down the\nranks through the lower levels. For example, those within the sales department should be given to understand that contrived methods to increase\nreported sales—side letters, quarter‐end telephone calls to friendly customers,\nlast‐minute discounting that is not revealed to the accounting department—\nwill not be tolerated. Analogous contrivances, such as a failure to close the\nquarter‐end books, are to be viewed as forbidden. At all levels, both egregious\nand subtle manipulations of the numbers are to be perceived as unacceptable.\nOne obvious vehicle of communication is a written code of conduct or mission statement, but let us candidly admit that such a written document can be\nalmost useless at best and counterproductive at worst.

That objective, therefore, should be plainly understood.

Like the rules of the NYSE and Nasdaq, they require that each audit\ncommittee member be independent. As to what “independence” means,\nSarbanes‐Oxley imposes two criteria.

Perhaps the input of a management representative can then be obtained by including the representative in\nsome audit committee meetings even without formal membership.\nFINANCIAL SOPHISTICATION\nEven audit committee members whose hearts are in the right place need to\nknow what they are doing. Therefore, a second fundamental prerequisite of\naudit committee membership is fi nancial sophistication.\nWhat kind of sophistication is meant? Here, the rules are particularly\nvague. The commentary to the NYSE rules specifi es only that “each member\nof the audit committee must be fi nancially literate, as such qualifi cation is interpreted by the listed company’s board in its business judgment.” The Nasdaq\nrules are only slightly more informative. They specify that each of the audit\ncommittee members must be “able to read and understand fundamental fi nancial statements, including a company’s balance sheet, income statement, and\ncash fl ow statement.” (See Exhibits 5.1 and 5.2 .)\nExperience suggests that audit comm", "created_at": "2026-01-03"}

The willingness\nto make the effort has got to be there.\nThe rules encourage audit committee willingness to make the effort in\nseveral ways, one of which is through the requirement of an audit committee “charter” (see Exhibits 5.5 and 5.6 ). The charter, which must be in writing, is to broadly outline the audit committee’s responsibility for oversight of\nfi nancial reporting.

As discussed in Chapter 1, accounting irregularities\ntypically start out small and well beneath the radar screen of the materiality\nthresholds of a typical audit. They start with a particular type of corporate environment, and it is a type of environment to which a normal once‐a‐year auditor\ncannot gain ready access.

Are they reluctant to report bad news? Is\nthere a danger they are camouflaging results? These types of questions are\nfundamental to the prevention and early detection of financial fraud.\nA key aspect of that environment is whether financial reporting determinations and judgments are being made with objectivity. The goal here recognizes that judgments under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)\nbest aim for “the middle of the fairway.” To say it another way, they should\nnot be influenced by operational or other business objectives such as meeting\nquarterly expectations or keeping the stock price up. A useful subject to question, therefore, is the extent to which such operational or business factors run\nthe risk of influencing financial reporting.\nThe importance of this topic is underscored by the insidiousness of the\nmeans by which objectivity can be compromised. Consider, for example,\nthe experience of a public company CEO. Each quarter, he admonished his\naccounting staff to inspect the books and records and search for needed\ncorrections—particularly if the company was falling short of analyst\nexpectations.

The life of a public company CEO has not gotten any easier. Now it’s not enough\nto grow the business, deliver stellar quarterly results, be an effective public\nspokesperson, look good at roadshows, protect the environment, and ensure a\nnonhostile workplace. Now the CEO has to serve as the foremost guardian of\nintegrity of the company’s fi nancial reporting system.\nThe key phrase here is “integrity of the system.” As a practical matter, there\nis simply no way that a public company CEO can be completely knowledgeable\nas to what is behind every single number in a company’s fi nancial statements.\nNonetheless, every quarter the CEO must certify that he has reviewed his company’s fi nancial report, that it is not false or misleading, and that the fi nancial\nstatements fairly present the company’s fi nancial condition. As frightening as\nthe prospect may be, the CEO as a practical matter has no alternative but to\nrely on the system by which the fi nancial information is generated.

For a public company CEO\nfaced with evidence of a serious fi nancial reporting transgression, the sentences can go up to 20 years.\nSo there is ample incentive for a modern CEO to strive to the utmost for\naccuracy in fi nancial reporting.

The benefi t of subcertifi cations stems from the notion that, as Samuel Johnson reportedly once said,\n“When a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates the mind\nwonderfully.” The thinking is that, faced with a requirement of a written subcertifi cation of fi nancial results, a lower‐level executive’s incentive to ensure\nthe accuracy of those results is correspondingly increased.

It is when performance targets become overly aggressive that accounting irregularities can get their start. The delicate challenge\nfor the CEO is to put in place budgets and projections that maximize effort while\nremaining grounded in reality.\nA budget that is established through an unlistening CEO’s edict, accordingly, carries with it the potential for disaster. So does a budget that results from\nan unrealistic preoccupation with sustaining a particular revenue growth\ncurve, attaining the performance expectations of outside analysts, or otherwise satisfying the somewhat arbitrary performance objectives of outsiders.\nTrue, the performance objectives of outsiders, including the shareholders who\nown the company, certainly must be understood and considered. However, to\ngive them the definitive role in establishing budgets is to risk the health of the\ncompany’s financial reporting culture.\nThat takes us to the issue of holding executives accountable for performance, and this area is similarly fraught with peril.

The more\npressure on the executive, the more difficult the temptation can be to resist.\nIn the wrong kind of high‐pressure environment, the notion of some level of\naccounting adjustment—often in a way that an executive may rationalize to\nbe completely permissible—looks increasingly attractive.

As strange as it may sound, sometimes failure\nneeds to be an option.

The\nCEO himself may not have a terribly good grasp on exactly what kind of fi nancial reporting environment he is creating.

If the evidence potentially implicates senior management—as evidence\nof fraudulent fi nancial reporting frequently does—the audit committee will\nnot want outside counsel whose allegiances are divided. For that reason, the\ncompany’s regular outside counsel—regardless of its reputation or expertise—\nwill rarely, and probably never, suffi ce. It is too awkward to ask regular outside\ncounsel to investigate the management that has been, up to now, paying its\nmonthly bills. That is not to say that the audit committee must never engage\nany counsel that has done even a moment’s work for the company—for some\nlarge companies that might rule out pretty much all counsel that knows anything about fraudulent fi nancial reporting. Still, it must be clear that the audit\ncommittee’s counsel is prepared to objectively and earnestly investigate senior\nmanagement. If there is a question as to that, then someone else is needed.\n\n138 ◾ Detection and Its Aftermath\nA question that sometimes arises is whether counsel should be disqualifi ed from service to the audit committee if it has earlier represented the auditor of the company’s fi nancial statements.

Indeed, the interests of the audit committee, the audit\ncommittee’s counsel, and the auditor should all be completely aligned: objectively evaluating the problem and doing the right thing to set things straight.\nALERTING THE COMPANY'S AUDITOR\nSpeaking of the auditor, once corroborating information is found of fraudulent\nfi nancial reporting, if not earlier, the outside auditor should be made aware.\nThere are several reasons. Foremost is the fact that the auditor will expect to\nbe told about such information promptly. The company will soon fi nd that the\nsupport of its auditor is critical to digging its way out of the problem, and that\nsupport is best earned by establishing up front that the audit committee can\nbe trusted to keep the auditor informed.

Failure to alert the auditor of potential\nfi nancial fraud is not a way to get things started on the right foot.\nAnother reason involves the auditor’s own legal obligations where possible illegal acts have been uncovered at an audit client. Known within the\naccounting profession as the auditor’s “10A responsibilities”—named after\nthe statutory section of the federal securities laws in which the responsibilities\nappear—they involve the auditor’s duty to evaluate whether the audit committee is taking “timely and appropriate remedial actions” in response. Auditors\nview this responsibility with the utmost seriousness, and a failure to alert the\nauditor in the fi rst place can right away call into question whether the audit\ncommittee’s reactions to the problem qualify as “timely and appropriate.”\nSECURING DOCUMENTS\nAn immediate task—by this point, there will be an ever‐growing list of\nimmediate tasks—will be to see that documents are being adequately secured.\n\nSenior Management Culpability ◾ 139\nIndeed, steps to secure documents may begin taking place as corroborating\ninformation begins to be found or, better still, as soon as the problem initially\nsurfaces.\nEnsuring the security of the company’s documentary records is critical for\na number of reasons.

Foremost, if there is in fact a fi nancial fraud, the odds are\nthat some of the most revealing evidence will be found within the company’s\nemail system. That email system must be preserved. Should it not be, it may\ntake weeks, months, or even years to put together the puzzle of what actually\nhappened. No audit committee wants to see an investigation drag out endlessly\nwhen it could have been brought to a much more prompt conclusion if corporate records had simply been kept.\nAnother reason for securing documents involves the company’s regulators, foremost among them the SEC. Once the SEC staff is informed of the\nproblem, one of its fi rst questions will be whether corporate records have been\npreserved. If the answer is not affi rmative, the SEC’s skepticism of the audit\ncommittee will immediately increase as it views the committee as inept, corrupt, or both. As with the auditor, winning over the trust of the SEC is critical\nto effi ciently getting things straightened out.

Adding to the frustration is that suspect senior\nexecutives may be at the height of their careers with national reputations.\nDischarging such an executive, or simply placing him or her on a leave of\nabsence, is disruptive and distasteful—and that’s before even getting to unfair.\nAt the same time, it is important to get wrongdoing senior executives out of\nthe company fast. Beyond the fact that a company cannot be run by crooks, of\nlater importance to a successful investigation will be the tone and the environment in which it is conducted.

Once it is determined that existing SEC fi lings can no longer be\nrelied upon, it will be time to issue a press release to that effect.\nOne frustrating aspect of such a press release is that, no matter how much\nit would like to, the company cannot control its timing. Ideally, of course, the\ncompany would be able to wait until all the facts are in—the extent of the fraud,\nwho was involved, the corrections to the numbers, and personnel changes.\nAlas, that is rarely the case. More likely, events will conspire to require a press\nrelease while the information is still uncertain at best.\nThere are several reasons. The fi rst is simply the fact that, if enough is\nknown to render the fi nancial statements unreliable, failure to promptly issue\na press release potentially allows innocent shareholders to continue to trade\nbased on fraudulent information.

Still, if reliance on the information is no longer justified, good conscience requires that\nthe company say so.\nIf good conscience doesn’t do it, there’s always the outside auditor. Under\nthe standards of the accounting profession, an auditor is not allowed to sit by\nand watch financial markets trade based on audited financial statements that,\nowing to subsequently discovered evidence, now appear to be false. Thus, as\nsoon as the auditor understands that the situation involves materially misstated financial statements, the auditor will begin alerting the board of the\nneed for a press release with corrective information.\nStill another source of time pressure for a press release may be the potential for irregular trading in the company’s stock.

For its part, the outside auditor of the fi nancial statements,\nupon a determination that fi nancial statements underlying its audit reports are\nno longer reliable, will want to see that the press release makes an explicit statement to that effect. The main challenge is to avoid overstating or understating\nthe problem, all the while recognizing that it may be worse than it presently\nseems. In situations where the known quantifi cation is below accepted materiality levels, there may be a temptation to refer in the press release to a lack of\nmateriality. However, in the absence of reliable data, that temptation should\nprobably be resisted. The SEC staff has historically viewed such preliminary\nassessments of nonmateriality with skepticism, and can have a harsh reaction\nif a subsequent disclosure reveals that the problem turned out to be much bigger than initially believed.\nUnderstandably, a company in its initial press release will want to alert\nfi nancial markets as to what the correct fi nancial results should be.

The countervailing concern\nis that any corrected results the company provides at a preliminary stage may,\nupon a more thorough investigation, turn out to be wrong as the problem turns\nout to be bigger than understood at the time. Thus, a well‐intentioned press\nrelease providing early quantifi cation may end up understating the problem,\nthereby making things worse rather than better as the audit committee itself\nis now inadvertently drawn into some level of additional misreporting. As\nmuch as the audit committee might want to share its initial assessment of the\nfi nancial statement impact of the problem, premature quantifi cation that runs\nthe risk of understatement is best avoided.\nINFORM THE SEC?\nOne question likely to ignite healthy debate is whether the audit committee\nshould, even at a preliminary stage, reach out to the SEC.\nTo some, the suggestion would seem idiotic. At this point, pretty much\neverything seems to be going wrong. The company may not be sure that there\nwas even a fraud let alone who was involved in it. The company may not be sure\nwhether its fi nancial statements are materially misstated or, if so, the extent\nof the misstatement.

And whatever corrective steps the company has taken so far, it is a safe bet that when everything is\nuncovered it will not be enough.\n\nThe Securities Exchange ◾ 143\nBut there are factors going the other way. One is that, particularly given\nthe fi nancial incentives put in place by Dodd‐Frank, it might make sense to\nassume that, once the audit committee has learned of a potential fraud, somebody has a lready gone to the SEC. For that matter, by the time the audit committee has found out, the SEC may have already started an investigation. If\nthe SEC later fi nds out that the audit committee itself was alerted, and did not\naffi rmatively reach out to self‐report to the SEC staff, it might have a negative\nreaction. Certainly that is not the way for the audit committee to make a good\nfi rst impression.\nMore fundamentally, a critical objective of the audit committee, mentioned\nearlier, will be to earn the SEC’s trust. The reason is that one of the audit committee’s main objectives will be to gain the SEC’s permission to investigate the\nproblem itself. The audit committee can do it more effi ciently, more quickly, and\nprobably with less disruption than an outside investigation by SEC staff.

Still, such\nan outreach can pay great dividends as the investigation proceeds. (See more\nabout this in Chapter 11 .)\nTHE SECURITIES EXCHANGE\nThe SEC will not be the only regulators interested in what is going on.\nRegulatory responsibility is also vested in the stock exchange where the company’s stock trades. So there is still another item for the audit committee’s to‐do\nlist: reaching out to the stock exchange to let it know of the problem before the\nexchange reads about it in the newspapers.\nThe major exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq,\nhave requirements regarding the reliability of publicly fi led fi nancial information and, where fi nancial fraud has surfaced, those requirements may have\nbeen violated.

But other\nthings are important as well. One of them is cash.\nThe prospect of running out of cash often takes a typical audit committee,\nor for that matter a typical board of directors, by surprise. Often both insiders\nand outsiders alike have grown accustomed to thinking of the company as fl ush\nwith cash. It may have plenty of cash in the bank. It may have a substantial\nrevolving credit facility. It may have terrifi c lending relationships. It may have\nan additional borrowing capacity that has historically proved to be more than\nenough for the company’s needs.\nUnfortunately, that can change the moment that fi nancial fraud has\nsurfaced. Among other things, if the company has any debt, it may have\nviolated its lending agreement insofar as the fi nancial statements earlier provided to the bank may have been false. For example, a lending agreement\nmight provide:\n12. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES\n12.4 Financial Statements and Projection .

A problem here is that, for a variety of reasons, D&O insurance policies\ntypically decline to provide coverage for deliberate fraud. A D&O insurance\npolicy, for example, may contain the following among the policy “exclusions”:\nThe Insurer shall not be liable to make any payment for Loss in connection with a Claim made against an insured . . . arising out of, based\nupon, or attributable to the committing in fact of any criminal or deliberate fraudulent act.\nHowever, the extent to which such a clause would completely preclude\ncoverage is not always clear. For example, not all directors and offi cers named\nas defendants in the litigation will necessarily be knowing participants in the\nfraud. And the fraud of wrongdoing executive offi cers will not necessarily be\nimputed to innocent directors and offi cers under the policy. But there is an\n\n146 ◾ Detection and Its Aftermath\nexception: D&O policies sometimes provide that execution of the insurance\napplication by one of the perpetrators of the fraud may cause that person’s\nknowledge to be imputed to other insured persons and to the company.

They will be right. However,\na strong intuitive sense by itself may not carry the day upon the realization\nthat the investigation may cost millions of dollars and keep the company in\nlegal limbo for months on end. Therefore, let’s look beyond the intuitive sense\nand break down some of the key reasons that an investigation will ordinarily\nbe in order.\nThe starting point is that the company has now lost faith in its public disclosures of fi nancial performance. That will need to be fi xed. And it is not enough\nto simply alert markets that previously issued fi nancial results are wrong—\noutsiders will want to know what the correct numbers should have been. The\nonly way to fi nd out is to dig into the numbers and distinguish falsifi ed results\nfrom the real ones.\nBeyond the need to set the numbers straight, the company will need to\nidentify those complicit in the fraud and deal with them.

A third is just as compelling: The company needs an audit report on its fi nancial statements. The need for a new audit\nreport arises with the likelihood that, once a company’s fi nancial statements\nhave been found to be unreliable, the company’s external auditor will want to\npull its existing report. As a practical matter, “pulling its report” involves the\nauditor’s encouragement that the company issue a press release that previously\nissued fi nancial statements are not to be relied upon. Once the company issues\nsuch a press release, it will enter what might be thought of as legal free‐fall. It\nwill be out of compliance with any number of SEC regulations.

A\nkey attribute for which the auditor—as well as the SEC—will be on the lookout\nis that the investigation is overseen by the audit committee.\nThe reasons for audit committee oversight are several. In public companies,\nit is the audit committee that has explicit legal responsibility for oversight of fi nancial reporting, and accounting fraud falls squarely within the subject of fi nancial\nreporting. In addition, the audit committee, as a matter of statutory design, is\nstructured to be independent and possessed of a level of fi nancial sophistication\nthat makes it the most viable subset of the board of directors to oversee the investigative efforts.

Those advocating a special committee may\nmake the argument that the fraud happened on the audit committee’s watch.\nTherefore, the argument goes, it is better to put together a new committee that\nis not similarly tarnished.\nThe argument might have some appeal, but normally not enough to prevail. The fact is that the law places upon the audit committee responsibility for\noversight of financial reporting and the law does not provide for audit committee delegation of that responsibility to a different committee of the board.\nNor does the fact that the fraud happened “on the audit committee’s watch”\nnecessarily call into question the audit committee’s objectivity or diligence.

The danger is that the committee gets put together\nbased less on need and talent and more on board politics. Particularly where\nsenior management has been pulling the fraud strings, the board may not be\noperating as a cohesive, collaborative body of corporate governance. For that\nmatter, some level of board dissension might have been deliberately sown by the\nCEO. Under such circumstances, the selection of special committee members\ncan be influenced by political considerations other than getting to the bottom\nof things. Often, the better approach will be to stick with the approach put in\nplace by the law. The audit committee oversees the investigation.\nSome members of management, particularly senior management, will\naccept the benefits of audit committee oversight of the investigation and\nrecognize the need. Some, however, may not. They may instead insist on an\ninvestigation overseen by company management.

True, the\ninvestigation may have some credibility to the extent it finds executives guilty.\nBut, to the extent it does not, observers will wonder whether determinations of\ninnocence were the result of managerial influence. The result is that such an\ninvestigation is incapable of credibly reaching determinations of innocence—it\nonly has credibility to the extent it finds people guilty.

Individual audit committee members may choose to sit in on interviews,\nand that is their choice. But it is audit committee counsel who will actually\nconduct the investigation.\nThe other group of professionals is the forensic accountants. Audit committee counsel, while knowledgeable of fi nancial reporting obligations and\ninvestigative techniques, will probably not possess a suffi ciently detailed\nknowledge of accounting systems, generally accepted accounting principles\n(GAAP), or computerized ledgers. For that, audit committee counsel will look\nto a category of accountants specifi cally trained in digging into fi nancial\nrecords for evidence of fraud.\nWHAT IS THE AUDIT COMMITTEE LOOKING FOR?\nWhat exactly is the audit committee looking for in such an investigation? There\nare primarily two things. The fi rst, obviously enough, is what the actual numbers should have been. In some cases that may be fairly straightforward. If a\ncompany has purchased an asset for $5 million, but recorded it on its books at a\ncost of $10 million, it is not too diffi cult to see through that one.

Comparison of\nthe debit in the general ledger to the underlying general ledger support should\nexpose the discrepancy. The result: Reduce the asset by $5 million.\nBut that was an easy one. And, in the world of fi nancial fraud, things are\nrarely that easy. Often fraudulent entries involve judgment calls where the\noperative question is not whether the number matches the underlying fi nancial records but whether the judgment behind the number was exercised in\ngood faith. In establishing, say, a reserve for bad debts, an executive will want\nto look into the future and come to the most realistic estimate of the extent to\nwhich current receivables will or will not be collected. The operative question\nfor the investigators is whether the executive exercised his judgment in good\nfaith to make the best estimate allowed by reasonably available information.\nSometimes it is not so easy to tell.\n\nScope of the Investigation ◾ 153\nBeyond the correct numbers, the second thing for which the investigators\nare looking is executive complicity. In other words: Who did it? Again, the good\nfaith of those potentially involved comes into play. The investigators are not\nseeking simply whether executives reported fi nancial results that turned out\nto be wrong. The issue rather is whether the executives tried to get them right.\nIf they did and made an honest mistake or estimated incorrectly, that does not\nsound like fraud and may not even be a violation of GAAP to begin with.\nThe main point here is", "created_at": "2026-01-03"}

In other\nwords, they are looking for an intentional misapplication of GAAP or an\napproach to GAAP that is so reckless as to constitute the equivalent of an intentional misapplication. A useful operational defi nition is provided by the courts\npursuant to the federal securities laws. The operative term there is s cienter and\nintellectual justifi cation for that concept is that scienter is the state of mind\nconstituting a prerequisite to the federal securities laws’ main antifraud provision. Scienter has the additional benefi t of interpretive judicial precedent as to\nwhen it does or does not exist.\nAn important corollary is that the audit committee will not normally want\nto go so far as to investigate negligence, that is, a failure to use “reasonable\ncare.” Negligence generally is not a crime.

A board of directors, or in this case\nthe audit committee, should have every expectation that executives will make\nthemselves available to answer questions and, when questions are posed, tell\nthe truth. An executive who declines to do either should not assume that he\nwill remain on the payroll for very long.\nAn additional incentive is an executive’s desire to tell his side of the story.\nIf an executive is innocent, he has every reason to cooperate so that his perspective is understood and his innocence made clear. Not only will such an\nexecutive want to tell the truth. He will want to appear to be cooperative to\nshow that he has nothing to hide. An innocent executive has little incentive\nto play hard‐to‐get.\nIs the same true for wrongdoers? It depends on how cagey they are. Certainly\neven a wrongdoer wants to create an appearance of cooperation and innocence.\nIf the wrongdoing executive believes his persuasiveness will throw the investigators off the trail, all the better.

That\nis particularly the case if they’ve engaged their own outside counsel who will\nforeseeably advise wrongdoers to keep their mouths shut.\nFor all of these reasons, it is a rare audit committee that actually has the\nability to investigate everyone. More likely, some individuals—including key\nones—will not cooperate at all. Normally, though, the inability to interview\neveryone does not preclude investigative determinations.

As a general matter, those wanting to understand what happened will seek a report in writing.\nThe auditor, for example, will often prefer a written report (see Chapter 10). The\nsame is true of the SEC (see Chapter 11). Indeed, as to the SEC, it is established\npolicy that a key question in evaluating whether an audit committee deserves\ncredit for regulatory cooperation is: “Did the company produce a thorough and\nprobing written report detailing the findings of its review?”\nOn balance, therefore, an audit committee will frequently conclude that\na written report is the way to go.

Third,\nit’s best if the entry can be quietly adjusted now and then corrected in some\nsubsequent quarter. The overall objective (to the extent that you are thinking\nit through) is to falsify an entry to gain an immediate earnings boost and then\nto quietly adjust it back to normal as soon as you can. If the entry can be corrected before the year‐end audit, all the better.\nWhat do you do? What entries drop right to the bottom line and are hard to\ndetect and second‐guess?

One study\nof financial fraud cases found that, over a two‐year period, issues involving\nrevenue recognition were implicated 40 percent of the time.\nAs the executive becomes increasingly desperate, creative thinking may\nresult in the discovery of more innovative ways that revenue can be manipulated. One, for example, involves “bill‐and‐hold transactions”—transactions\nin which revenue can be recognized even though the product has not been\nshipped.

But, for an executive who is genuinely desperate, one does what one\nhas to do.\nReserves\nAs illustrated at the outset, an area ripe with opportunity for manipulation\ninvolves the use of reserves. Although the term reserves is used broadly, in this\ninstance we are talking about pools based on an estimate that either reduces\nthe value of an asset (e.g., an allowance or reserve for bad debts) or establishes\na liability for costs expected to be incurred in the future (e.g., damages relating\nto a lawsuit).\nThe reason reserves may be candidates for manipulation is that reserves\nby their nature often involve some element of prediction. The precise number,\ntherefore, can never be known. Under GAAP, the appropriate reserve level is\ndetermined according to the best estimate of management based on its reasoned and informed judgment.\nWith regard to some reserves, the opportunities for manipulation are fairly\nconstrained. If, for example, a company has consistently experienced a 90 percent collection rate on its receivables over the last 20 years, it is hard to argue\nthat suddenly the reserve should be reduced from 10 percent to 2 percent absent\nany demonstrable changes that would dramatically improve collections.

One of the most famous frauds of the past century—\nMcKesson‐Robbins during the 1930s—turned on inventory fraud. It was\nspecifically because of the inventory fraud at McKesson‐Robbins that audit\nstandards were rewritten to enhance auditor observation as to inventory.\nToday, inventory remains rich with opportunity. One reason is the need\nto record inventory at the lower of cost or market. Although cost is objectively\nverifiable, market value sometimes is not. GAAP also necessitate judgments\nas to the time at which recorded inventory levels should be reduced or perhaps\nwritten off entirely.\nAnother problem with inventory involves the clumsiness inherent in physical inspection and verification. Although audit standards generally call upon\nan auditor to undertake some level of physical observation of inventory, even\nhere the auditor relies on techniques of statistical sampling and random tests.\nIn the event of fraud, such tasks are never foolproof.

Other methods used to circumvent the\nphysical inspection and verification process include manipulating inventory\ncounts at locations not visited by the auditor and falsifying records regarding\ninventory reported to be in transit.\nExpenses\nExpense manipulation isn’t usually the first choice, but sometimes it gets used\nto help cover tracks. The manipulation of expenses can be more difficult than,\nsay, the manipulation of reserves, because expense amounts are normally\nobjectively verifiable and, under GAAP, there is typically not much room for\ndiscretion. Nonetheless, expense recognition can be delayed, thereby artificially\nenhancing profitability.\n\n168 ◾ Finding the False Numbers\nOne aspect of the recording of expenses, moreover, is more susceptible to\nfraud than the others.

One reason may simply be a practical\none. The audit committee may not know who within the company was involved\nand may lack the internal resources to conduct a preliminary investigation\nfrom within. The audit committee may want to seek the assistance of the auditor because, as a practical matter, the audit committee has nowhere else to turn.\nBeyond the practicalities, there is an additional reason for early involvement of the outside auditor. The relationship between the company and the\noutside auditor is about to undergo a period of great stress (see ahead). It will\nbe critical for the audit committee to keep the outside auditor’s trust—or, if\nthat trust has dissipated, to regain it—and candor with the auditor will be\nkey.

A source of perennial audit committee confusion is the\ndifference in the function of each.\nThe main difference between a conventional audit and a forensic investigation involves the principal assumption that constitutes the engagement’s\npredicate. In a normal audit, the predicate is that, absent evidence to the contrary, management of the company, while perhaps not perfect, is approaching\nits fi nancial reporting in good faith and seeking to prepare fi nancial statements\nthat fairly present the fi nancial position of the company in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The basic approach to the\naudit, therefore, involves the auditor’s receipt of draft fi nancial statements from\nthe client; the selection of samples of fi nancial data to be subject to audit testing;\ntesting of the sampling of accounts; communication to the company of fi nancial statement amounts that, based on the audit testing, need to be adjusted;\nand the formulation of a judgment regarding whether th", "created_at": "2026-01-03"}

An auditor is called upon to make a judgment about the risk of\na material misstatement due to fraud and in light of that judgment to design\nappropriate audit tests. Still, absent evidence to the contrary, the auditor will\ngenerally not assume management to be dishonest. The technical term describing the approach is “professional skepticism.” At its core, professional skepticism encourages the auditor to be a skeptic but not to assume the falsity of\neverything everybody says.\nIn a forensic investigation, that approach changes to the complete opposite.\nOnce it has been established that the bookkeeping has been infected by fraudulent fi nancial reporting, the issue for the forensic accountant is: How deep and\nwidespread does it go?\nTherefore, in the eyes of a forensic accountant, anyone might be a suspect.\nMembers of the board of directors, senior executives, those in middle‐level\nmanagement, right down to a truck driver transporting potentially fi ctitious goods—all may be initially subject to the forensic accountant’s exacting scrutiny.

Whereas, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the outside auditor would ordinarily start with the presumption regarding, say, the genuineness of documents, forensic accountants\nmay exhaustively search for evidence that either validates key documents or\nestablishes their falsity.

Logically, the work of the forensic accountants needs to come first. Until the forensic accountants have rooted out the\nfraud, there are no theoretically correct financial statements for the auditor\nto audit. However, the urgency that normally accompanies an audit committee investigation often results in a desire that the auditor commence its audit\nprocedures as soon as it feasibly can.\nOne consequence of all this is that coordination between the forensic\naccountants and the outside auditor can be a challenge. While both share a\ncommon objective—the issuance of properly stated financial statements—the\npressures and difficulties of the environment can sometimes lead to stress\nbetween the two.

That, though, is a luxury that neither can\nafford. Each needs the other. The forensic accountants need the auditor because\nthe auditor has possession of knowledge and workpapers that can get the forensic investigation off to a more efficient start. Information about period‐end\nadjusting journal entries, conversations with management regarding suspicious transactions, even important aspects of the audit chronology—all of\nthese will be just sitting in the auditor’s historical workpapers waiting for the\nforensic accountants’ review.\nBut the need for information is not simply a one‐way street.

In particular, as extra\nprotection regarding the integrity of its new audit, the auditor needs to know\nthe results of the forensic accountant’s investigation. Was the CEO in on the\nfraud?

For the auditor, simply turning away\nfrom the forensic accountants and offering no cooperation is not an attractive option.\n\n186 ◾ Getting a New Audit Report on the Financial Statements\nA truce will therefore be established. The auditor will normally allow the\nforensic accountants access to its workpapers to assist in the speed and effi -\nciency of the forensic investigation. And the audit committee will agree that\nformulation of a conclusion as to the adequacy of the auditor’s prior work is\nnot an objective of the audit committee investigation.

In the absence of evidence\nto the contrary, the incumbent auditor to some extent will generally be\nable to rely on audit work it has already performed.

Such additional efforts can be particularly\ntime consuming where the irregularities have affected multiple years.\n2. Information. Often, the auditor’s workpapers will contain documents that\nshed light on the origin of and parties responsible for the fraud. For example, an auditor may have copies of documents that turn out to have been\naltered or evidence of misrepresentations made to the auditor by company\npersonnel.

Prior‐year audit reports. When financial fraud is determined not to extend\nback to multiple years, a company may wish to continue to rely on prior\nyears’ audit reports. For example, applicable regulations generally require\na company to keep on record a total of three successive years of audited\nfinancial statements. If the company terminates its incumbent auditor or\notherwise isolates the auditor from the investigation findings, the auditor may withhold its consent to incorporate its audit reports from prior\nyears.

Historically, materiality\nassessments have typically focused upon the application of certain numerical\nthresholds. By convention, potential adjustments below 5 percent were less\ninclined to be viewed as material. Potential adjustments above 10 percent were\nmore inclined to be viewed as material.\nIn August 1999, the staff of the SEC tried to jolt the fi nancial community into assessments of materiality that focused less on numerical thresholds and more on the potential signifi cance of the item to investors. The\nSEC’s pronouncement was entitled “Staff Accounting Bulletin Number 99”\nor “SAB 99,” and its gist was that “there are numerous circumstances in\nwhich misstatements below 5 percent could well be material.” For SAB 99,\nassessment of materiality did not involve simply the application of numerical thresholds, but “qualitative factors” that “may cause misstatements of\nquantitatively small amounts to be material.” Among such factors was “how\nthe misstatement arose.” According to SAB 99, deliberate misstatements\nwere more likely to be viewed as material. SAB 99 provides: “It is unlikely\nthat it is ever ‘reasonable’ for registrants to record misstatements or not to\ncorrect known misstatements—even immaterial ones—as part of an ongoing effort directed by or known to senior management for the purposes of\n‘managing’ earnings.”\nIn promulgatin", "created_at": "2026-01-03"}

It arguably made sense to prevent companies, prior to the issuance of\ntheir fi nancial statements, from failing to correct known misstatements of\nless than 5 percent solely in an attempt to sustain a company’s stock price.\nHowever, applied to the potential need to correct fi nancial statements that\nhave already been issued, the logic behind SAB 99’s view of materiality\nbecomes less workable. Suppose, for example, that a company discovers that\n\nRestatements and Materiality ◾ 193\nin the previous year it mistakenly reported earnings 1 percent higher than\nit should have because of an honest blunder in counting inventory. Insofar\nas the prior financial statements now include a “known misstatement,” does\nthat render the financial statements “materially” misleading? Does it make a\ndifference if, rather than being accidental, the inventory misstatement was\ndeliberate? Does it matter if the discrepancy happened two years, rather than\none year, before?\nAt the moment, SAB 99’s impact on such questions is unclear.

To address this issue, the SEC staff has issued “Staff\nAccounting Bulletin No. 108” or “SAB 108.” SAB 108 acknowledges that, in\nsuch an instance, there are two ways of looking at materiality. One, known as\nthe “rollover approach,” quantifies a misstatement based on the amount of the\nerror originating in each of the successive years. For example, the materiality\nof a $20 misstatement in each of five years would be evaluated based on the\nmateriality of the misstatement in each of the years in which it originated.

Before the audit report is issued, the auditor is to obtain a\n“representation letter” setting forth, among other things, the representations\nof responsible executives that the fi nancial statements are set forth in accordance with GAAP and that the auditor has been provided with all pertinent\ninformation. That representation letter is to be signed by executives whose\nknowledge of the fi nancial reporting system is such that an adequate basis for\nthe representations exists. Beyond the formal representations of the representation letter, any number of executives and accounting personnel will make\nseparate representations during the course of the audit that the auditor will\ndocument in its workpapers.\nWhat can be routine in a normal audit, however, can become more of a\nproblem once fraud has been discovered.

The need for management representations\ncan therefore delay the release of audited financial statements if not dealt with\nearly in the audit process. At the outset, company management and its auditor should do their best to achieve a clear understanding of the personnel from\nwhom the auditor will seek written representations and exactly what those\nrepresentations will consist of. Of course, even the best of planning in this area\nmay be ruined if the investigation finds fault with individuals from whom the\nauditor had planned to obtain representations.\nBeyond the normal representations of management, the auditor may\nseek additional representations regarding the adequacy of the audit committee’s investigation and the disclosure of investigative results and underlying evidence to the auditor. Thus, for example, the auditor may ask the audit\ncommittee to represent to the best of the committee’s knowledge and belief\nthat: (1) the auditor has been provided with access to all relevant documents\nand information in connection with the investigation, (2) the investigation is\ncomplete, (3) the investigation is sufficient for the audit committee to determine\nthe appropriateness of inclusion of the financial statement", "created_at": "2026-01-03"}

If all has been properly handled, the board will have undertaken an investigation, alerted the public through a press release, terminated\nthe employment of those whose complicity was clear, and handled innumerable\nproblems involving creditors, employees, suppliers, and others. Looking back,\nindividual board members may be genuinely astonished at the alacrity with\nwhich diffi cult issues have been handled.\nThere is at least one aspect of the problem, however, where speed and effi -\nciency of resolution most notably will not be the case. That is the aspect dealing\nwith class action litigation. For the board, the litigation will likely proceed with\nexasperating ineffi ciency, delay, and expense.

The law then generally permits that single shareholder to\nsue on behalf of all similar shareholders.\nAlthough the conceptual justifi cation for class action litigation begins\nwith the predicate of an aggrieved shareholder reaching out to a lawyer to\nseek redress, the reality is somewhat different. Shareholder class action litigation tends to be prosecuted by a small number of highly specialized law fi rms\nand, over the years, these fi rms have developed practices and relationships that\nenable them to take the lead in commencing shareholder litigation almost on\ntheir own. A practical consequence is that, within days after issuance of a press\nrelease revealing fi nancial fraud, the class action lawyers will normally have\ntheir lawsuits already prepared.\nCOMMENCEMENT OF CLASS ACTION LITIGATION\nThe catalyst for commencement of the litigation will often be the initial press\nrelease (see Exhibit 13.1 ).

The main candidates of\nthose who may be named in the class action complaints are as follows:\n▪▪ The company. The corporate entity will almost inevitably be named a\ndefendant.

The plaintiffs’ lawyers will infer from any such corporate action the\noffi cers’ complicity in wrongdoing.\n▪▪ The CEO and the CFO. Prime candidates to be included as defendants are the\nchief executive offi cer and the chief fi nancial offi cer. The plaintiffs will infer\nfrom their positions some level of complicity. Also, they will have signed\nwhat have now turned out to be incorrect SEC fi lings, such as a Form 10‐K\nor Forms 10-Q.\n▪▪ Particular offi cers. Beyond the CEO and CFO, other offi cers may be named as\ndefendants depending on the nature of the fraud (as described in the press\nrelease) and a particular offi cer’s proximity to it. For example, if the fraud\ninvolved improper revenue recognition on consignment sales, the plaintiffs\n\n248 ◾ Class Action Lawsuits\nmay seek to include as a defendant the offi cer or offi cers with responsibility\nin that area.

Where the company has publicly issued stock within the last\nthree years, the underwriters may be included. For the corporate issuer,\nthis is particularly unfortunate insofar as typical underwriting documents will provide for corporate indemnifi cation of the underwriter in the\nabsence of the underwriter’s own wrongdoing.\n▪▪ Selling shareholders.

Section 20, also a provision of the\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, operates to impose liability on those who\ncontrol another person who makes a significant false or misleading statement in SEC filings “unless the controlling person acted in good faith and\ndid not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or cause of action.” Thus, for example, a consolidated complaint might\nallege that a large shareholder should be equally liable with the company.\nAn inside director or high‐ranking officer may also be alleged to control\n\nThe Consolidated Complaint ◾ 251\nthe corporation. The actual circumstances that constitute control under\nSection 20 are frequently an issue of dispute.\n▪▪ Section 12(a)(2). Unlike Sections 10(b) and 20 of the 1934 Act, Section 12(a)\n(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 does not apply to false or misleading statements in connection with secondary market purchases or sales of securities.\nThe role of Section 12(a)(2), rather, is much more limited: It applies only to\nfalse or", "created_at": "2026-01-03"}

On the other hand, to the extent that the class includes those\nwho are no longer shareholders, their reluctance to seek a cash payment\nfrom the company will be signifi cantly less pronounced. Another complicating factor, results from the fact that, where accounting irregularities have\nsurfaced, the company’s cash position may be somewhat tenuous.

Among the issues of contention will\nbe such things as the legal requirements of a satisfactory complaint (the courts\ndisagree with each other), the types of factual allegations that will satisfy those\nlegal requirements (as a practical matter, the court has a great deal of discretion), and the extent to which a plaintiff failing to include adequate allegations\nshould be given the opportunity to amend its consolidated complaint in order\nto make another try.

Logically, an early\nresolution would seem to make sense. If a material accounting irregularity has\nsurfaced, then both sides should theoretically recognize the extent to which\nshareholders have been harmed. The principal remaining obstacle would seem\nto be the calculation of resulting damages under the law and the negotiation of\nan appropriate settlement amount. Neither would seem like an insurmountable obstacle.\nStrategic considerations would seem to heavily favor an early negotiated\nresolution. For the plaintiffs, an early settlement can maximize recovery by\ntapping into the reservoir of D&O insurance when it is at its fullest point (i.e.,\nbefore it is depleted by the expenditure of defense costs) and can result in a\nrecovery for shareholders before the incurrence of substantial legal fees.

A particular advantage of an early settlement for the company stems\nfrom the removal of the horrifi c distraction of time‐consuming litigation at a\ntime when the company has more important operational and fi nancial issues\non which to focus.\nNonetheless, although some preliminary discussions of settlement may\ntake place, an early resolution of the litigation is by no means assured. The\nreasons are not particularly profound. Usually the plaintiffs want more money\nthan the defendants (or, more precisely, the defendants’ insurance companies)\nare willing to pay. That is not to say that early settlements never happen, but\nthey are the exception rather than the rule.\nTHE PROCESS OF DISCOVERY\nIn the absence of a settlement, the court will be given the time it needs to resolve\nthe motion to dismiss. Although, with resolution of the motion, some or even\nmost defendants may fi nd themselves dismissed from the case, some defendants\nmay remain. For those remaining defendants, the next step is to begin the pretrial investigation known as “discovery.”\nThe process of discovery has two main components.

It is largely a process in which the plaintiffs investigate\nthe defendants. The reason is straightforward: The plaintiff shareholders tend\nto have less information of importance to the case.

You take punch after punch but get to give very little in return.\nTHE PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS\nThe fi rst step in the discovery process will normally be a document request.\nThis consists of a list of documents to be made available to the plaintiffs.

We’ve looked at its origin.\nWe’ve looked at prevention. We’ve looked at detection and its aftermath, including investigation, the SEC, criminal implications, and class action\nlitigation. Seemingly, the entirety of the subject has been explored.\nBut there is another question left: Why? Why is it that, over the last twenty\nyears, we have seen such a dramatic increase in fraudulently reported fi nancial\nresults? And a good follow‐up question is: Have we adequately addressed the\nproblem?\nThe answer to the fi rst question has more to do with the nature of fi nancial\nreporting systems than anything else. The fact is that we have entered a period\nin which fi nancial market demands for information are not being met by the\nfi nancial reporting system that happens to be in place.

It was natural to assume that the information itself would be transmitted\nalmost entirely on paper.\nAt the core of this Depression‐era system, moreover, was the concept\nthat fi nancial information need be available only periodically. No one had\nreason to think that someday technological innovation would collapse the\ntime needed to assemble and report fi nancial information to days or even\nminutes.

The public in turn could make its investment\ndecisions in due course.\nHence, the original public reporting requirements of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934 contemplated the fi ling of fi nancial information only\nonce a year. Over time, the laudable objective of encouraging effi ciency in\nfi nancial markets caused this requirement to be changed to semiannually and\nquarterly. At root, though, the system remained a periodic one. In other words,\nthe underlying premise of the system continued to be that fi nancial information\nwould be made available only periodically. Today’s system is thus an anachronistic remnant of the technology (i.e., carbon paper and the printing press)\nthat existed when the system was designed.\nTrue to its historical underpinnings, the core of today’s fi nancial reporting system continues to be a fi nancial report that comes out once a year.
