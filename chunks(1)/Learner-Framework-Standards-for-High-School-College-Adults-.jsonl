Because each\nperson has his or her own pre-existing financial habits, relationship with money, and current\nfinancial situation, teaching personal finance is a unique subject that requires a specialized\nframework to promote higher levels of learning.\nThe standards were developed to establish key benchmarks that guide more efficient\ninstruction and learning across core personal finance topics. This framework supports a\ndiverse set of stakeholders, including:\n• Educators (anyone delivering financial literacy coursework). These standards set\nperformance goals for students, guidelines for educators, and tools for lesson plan\npreparation.\n• Learners (anyone learning personal finance topics). The framework provides learning\ngoals that can be used to conduct self-assessment and guidelines for self-directed\nlearning.\n• Organizations (groups involved in financial wellness programming). The standards give\npublic assurance that providers are held to the highest standards of practice and are\ncapable to quantify program performance.\nThese standards define what a person should know about personal finance across 10 core\nareas of rele", "created_at": "2026-01-03"}

The framework is designed to drive learners to higherorder thinking skill sets so they can apply what they have learned into real-life situations.\nThe NFEC has invested over a decade building, testing, and refining these standards.\n• Building. We brought together a team of subject matter experts, educators, learners,\nand individuals leading financial wellness programming to develop the standards.\n• Testing. Educational materials were developed based on these standards. The\nresources have been deployed directly by the NFEC to over 46,000 organizations and\nused by over 8,000 organizations.\n• Refining. Feedback was used to refine the standards based on new advancements\nand input from core stakeholders.\nI would like to personally thank everyone who contributed to the Framework and commend\nall those who have become involved in the financial education movement. Together we can\neducate the world’s citizens to make qualified financial decisions that improve their lives,\nthe lives of their loved ones, and the lives of people they reach around the globe.\n- Vince Shorb, CEO National Financial Educators Council\nNFEC Learner\n4\nFramework & Standards\nfor High School, College & Adults\n\nStandards Objectives: Drive Learners to\nHigher-order Thinking Skill Sets\nDOK Level 4 – Ext", "created_at": "2026-01-03"}
